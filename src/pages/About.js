                                                Hi there! I am <strong>Vaibhaw</strong>, born and brought up in the peaceful land of <strong>Saran, Bihar</strong>, India. A proud desi who survived the great ‚Äúcorona era‚Äù (yes, I‚Äôm still sneezing in fear of sanitizers üò∑), and someone who grew up dancing between the 90s and 20s era ‚Äì you know, cassette tapes to Spotify, landline phones to Face ID. Quite a ride!
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                I completed my 10th and 12th from the <strong>BSEB Board, Patna</strong>, which taught me patience... mostly while waiting for results. Then, I went on to do my B.Tech in <strong>Computer Science</strong> at the <strong>Himalayan Institute of Engineering and Technology</strong>, Kala-Amb, Himachal Pradesh (2018‚Äì2022). Mountains, Maggi, and machines ‚Äì that's how I rolled for four years!
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                Now, I live in <strong>Chandigarh</strong>, working as a <strong>Web Developer</strong> and chasing bugs (not real ones, the software kind üêû). I work with <strong>HTML, CSS, Bootstrap</strong> to <strong>PHP, jQuery, JS, WordPress, BigCommerce, Laravel, CS-Cart</strong>. I believe websites should look good, load fast, and not break after clicking a single button. Simple things, right?
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                When I‚Äôm not busy coding or fixing someone‚Äôs ‚Äúurgent bug,‚Äù I‚Äôm usually sipping on my forever love ‚Äì <strong>tea</strong> (seriously, I should own a tea startup by now). I also enjoy cold drinks but somehow end up back with chai. It‚Äôs like a toxic relationship I enjoy too much.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                I‚Äôve always been a tech lover. Even as a kid, I‚Äôd press every key on the keyboard just to ‚Äúsee what happens.‚Äù That curiosity led me here ‚Äì designing smart, responsive websites and building stuff that people actually use. Whether it's a business site, blog, or eCommerce platform ‚Äì I make sure everything works smooth like butter (Amul butter, of course üßà).
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                Apart from work, I‚Äôm all about good vibes and better jokes. I love connecting with like-minded folks, cracking harmless jokes, and sharing ideas over endless cups of tea. Whether you're looking to build your dream website, need a custom web solution, or just want to rant about your last client project ‚Äì I‚Äôm all ears!
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                So if you're someone who needs a <strong>friendly, reliable, and slightly tea-addicted developer</strong> for your next web adventure, don‚Äôt hesitate to say hi. You can find me coding away in Chandigarh or reaching caffeine overdose levels by evening. Let‚Äôs build something awesome together ‚Äì with humor, hustle, and HTML!
                                            </p>
